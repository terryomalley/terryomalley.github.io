## What I hope to achieve today  

- Assume your goal: fulfilling and succesful economics career outside academia & public policy e.g. tech data scientist 

- Share "what I wish I knew earlier"

- Skills that are only learned through experience, but early awareness helps 

# Overview 

1. My career and thinking about your own 
2. Data science and economics in tech 
3. Skills for success 
4. Advice for aspiring tech workers


# My career and thinking about your own  

## Me 

- UCD MA, 2013. PhD, 2019. 

![](img/mise.PNG)


## My Current Role 

- Principal Applied Scientist at Huawei Ireland Research Centre (IRC) 

- Applied Scientist role:
    
    - Work at the intersection of research and real-world product development (product, engineering) 
    -   Requires research experience and expertise in a field like economics, computer science, operations research, statistics/ML.  
    - Alongside engineering skills (e.g. ability to write a prototype software package), and business intuition 

## Typical day-in-the-life
    
- Read business slide decks on product leaders’ goals for next year 
- Read academic paper on applied analysis of cloud operations, econometric theory and practice  
- Write R/python/SQL code to conduct exploratory data analysis, prototype a new statistical model, conduct a simulation 
- Conduct calls with product teams in HQ to better understand business challenges and key goals
- Write document to clarify a business challenge and turn into a concrete science problem and disucss with colleagues
- Demonstrate scientific solution to business people or engineers. 


## How did I get here? {.scrollable}

**CBI** 

- Statistical models for loan-loss forecasting (published in *Journal of Financial Stability*) 
- Construction of data sets and statistical analyses used to inform macroprudential policy (why you can’t get a massive mortgage anymore) 

**Academic Work**  

- PhD 2019, while working in Central Bank 
- Published dissertation chapter in *Journal of Finance* (using CBI data) 

**What Were My Key Skills?**  

- Technical: reduced-form causal inference, economic modelling, R + SQL coding
- Communication: writing journal articles, presenting to policy and academic audiences 


## Transition to tech industry 

**Why?** 
    
- All those skills valuable in industry/private sector
     - Particularly in tech where *lots of data gets collected* by the nature of information systems         
- Greater weight on coding skills with emphasis on SQL, R/Python programming, and basic Unix command line proficiency
- Frequent opportunities to have real-world impact 
- Wide career opportunities 

**Challenges** 
    
- Pace of working 
- Engineering skills 
- Navigating ambiguity 


## Your career: assembling a portfolio of transferrable skills  {.scrollable}

- Hard to plan your career from the beginning. What will I want to do in 10 years? What will the job market look like?

- Portfolio theory: 
    - Diversify your skillset
    - Take more risk at the start of your career 

- Be open to opportunity and refine your transferable skills. 

- Technical skills: 
    - Econometrics 
    - Computing skills 

- Professional skills:	
    - Communication (stakeholders, managers)
    - Prioritisation and Time Management 
    - Navigating ambiguity
    - Networking  

- With strong technical and professional skills, along with networking, you create opportunities for yourself rather than just being subject to whims of market 

- Seek out projects/opportunities to refine your skills 


## Where you're going: key skills of data science leaders   {.smaller}

My opinion, based on considerable hours of introspection and many years of mistakes: 

1. Bridges technical and business worlds 
- Translate complex models into actionable advice and decisions 
- Recognise and take advantage of business leaders’ domain expertise 
2. Solves the highest-impact problems 
- Priortise speed of delivery while maintaining the required level of rigour 
- Ruthlessly prioritise valuable problems over interesting problems 
3. Lead through influence and not authority
- Communicates clear insights and actions rather than technical elegance 
- Navigates organisation politics to drive change  

# Economic Data Science 


## Tech Companies Run on Metrics {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Shareholders care about long-term value of business 
- Measurements that try capture the relevant intermediate or proxy factors that ultimately impact value 
- People make good careers from building and maintaining systems to calculate them

## Tech Companies Often Run Online Marketplaces 

- Udemy is not selling education products to students, it was selling teachers to students and students to teachers 
    - Economics of platform businesses are very different 

- Business leaders and engineers figure this out together over time, but economists who are technically skilled with business acumen can get their faster and avoid pitfalls  



## Tech Companies Collect a Huge Amount of Data 

- Like any business, their decisions benefit from evaluation 

- Unlike others, they naturally collect heaps of data 

- Internal AB testing platforms: ability to conduct randomised experiments 
    - Economists often contribute 

- But often messy and observational, tech-skilled economists can build data sets and answer causal questions
    - Business decisions are often causal questions 

- Amazon economists: vast majority are experts in Mostly Harmless Econometrics (Angrist & Pischke, 2009)


## Tech Companies Have Ability to Implement Novel Pricing {.smaller}

- Real-time price adjustments at scale using cloud infrastructure
- Economists helped design:
    - Yahoo!'s first search ad auctions
    - Google's AdWords bidding system
    - Uber's surge pricing algorithms
- Requires understanding of:
    - Price elasticity estimation
    - Marketplace equilibrium concepts


# Skills For Success 

Getting shit done 

## Adopt a Product Mindset {.scrollable}

**From Academic/Research Mindset to Product/Impact Mindset:**

- Always be solving problems by shipping products 
    - For any piece of work that you do, ask yourself what's the product your building? 
    - Then put yourself in your customer's shoes and ask how your product solves their problems

- Anything can be a product 
    - Document, slide deck, code, model 

**Principles:**

1. Outcomes > outputs
2. Iterate with MVPs (Minimum Viable Proof-of-Concept)
    - Race to close-the-loop. Start getting feedback early. 
3. Think in tradeoffs


## Prioritisation 

- 80-20 rule

- Most projects are like the orange line. Treating them like the blue line is bad. 

![](img/impact_time.png)

- Effective prioritisation is like solving a knapsack optimisation problem  
    - Continuously rank your tasks by $\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{effort}}$ and start from the top 


## Managing Up (communicating with your manager)

- Manager should be your ally and advocate

- Good managers will help you manage your trade-offs and remove 'blockers', but they are not mind readers 

1. Set clear expectations: "here are my priorities for this month, do you agree?"
2. Status update anxiety: email updates on progress, 'blockers' and next steps ahead of meeting 
3. Ask for feedback regularly: "how am I doing?", and don't be suprised by year-end feedback 

- No 'long ranger' behaviour. Build trust and be open with your manager. 

- Similar lessons apply to stakeholder communication: business stakeholders hate surprises 

## Communicating with stakeholders 

- Always be storytelling 

- Business stakeholders don't care about technical jargon or about what economic theory has to say about their business 

- They want to know what their problems are, how you plan on fixing them and if you've fixed their problems 

## Navigating Ambiguity 

- Ambiguity in modern professional environment: very unlikely that somebody will hand you a list of tasks and instruction manual 

- Ask lots of questions early. You get a free pass when you're new to a company or new to a project area 

- Write clear documents/ slides on problems and potential solutions and use them to align your manager/stakeholders

- break problems down into manageable chunks

## Developing professional skills early 

- All of these skills can be practised in disseration, work placements, group projects 


# Advice for Aspiring Tech Workers 

## Networking 

- Is very difficult 

- To get your CV looked at, you need a huge amount of luck or a referral from somebody working in the company 

- It's okay to contact people on LinkedIn without somebody introducing you first (via email for example)
    - Expect to be ghosted 
    - Be extremely direct and to the point 
    - Find common ground e.g. I read your work on XYZ for my disserations, we both studied UCD economics
    - Be courteous

## Your CV 

- Show, don't tell 

- Talk up your achievements, don't just naively present them. Tell your story. 

- Probably better advice on LinkedIn than I can give 

## Interviewing 

- Hiring is noisy. Interviewing gives hiring managers chance to see how you work. 

- Nothing to fear. Think of it as your opportunity to show off your achievements 
    - Like you're being interviewed on a podcast 

- STAR method 
    - You can make a huge difference here if you do it right 


- Solving coding problems: talk aloud about how you're solving the problem 



## Your first job is not your last 

- Even if you don't land your perfect role, you can immediately start to hone your professional skills 

- Your CV and interviewing skills will immediately get better 

- Grad programmes: Centrl Bank, consulting etc. 

- Internships often used in tech as extended job interviews.
