Hi. I am an economist and data scientist working in tech. 

Prior to jumping to industry, I worked as a research economist at the Central Bank of Ireland and did my PhD at University College Dublin.

I mainly work on causal inference and econometrics problems, as well as using microeconomic theory to help guide business decisions around things like selection, pricing and operations.
